# My-Domotica-Lua-Scripts

Hi, recently I have been playing around with domotica because I wanted to automate some elements of my home and be able to control this all from a central location.

After some research on the internet I found that the Z-Wave protocol was the most interesting to me as it supports encrypted communication.  I would not want anyone else but myself controlling my home equipment.

With this protocol choice I started to search for a controller able to control Z-Wave devices.

The Fibaro Home Center 2, which supports LUA scripting, did attract my attention becuase it has the nicest GUI interface, so I purchased the device and am implementing automation scripts for my home equipment, written in LUA, ever since.

The scripts in this repository are merely for documentation purposes of my own automation system, and may be of some help for other users as example to automate their own devices via LUA scripting.
